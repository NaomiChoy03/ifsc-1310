  <h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h2>
  <p>Progressive Enhancement is a strategy that allows users to access the basic content of a website. Users with better Internet access or additional brower features can use a more enhance version of the website. Progressive enhancement is important in modern web development because it is a good way for web developers to balance issues relating to building websites that can be accessed by people using unknown browsers.</p>

  <h2>Dragon Project Revision and Reflection</h2>
  <p>For this assignment, I ask that you collect feedback from a peer, family member, or a friend on your first attempt at the Dragon or Segway project. Using that feedback, Iâ€™d like you to attempt to address any issues or problems pointed out by your potential users. You should provide a link to the revised project (duplicate the directory in aws and then add a link to the revised project). You should also provide several paragraphs reflecting on the learning experience working on this project and your experience during the semester. What were the things you did well? What would you do differently if you had to start over? Also report on the feedback you received and what you did to address those issues or why you chose not to make the recommended changes. This should be posted on your homepage under the progressive enhancement writing assignment.</p>
