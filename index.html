  <h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h2>
  <p>Progressive Enhancement is a strategy that allows users to access the basic content of a website. Users with better Internet access or additional brower features can use a more enhance version of the website. Progressive enhancement is important in modern web development because it is a good way for web developers to balance issues relating to building websites that can be accessed by people using unknown browsers.</p>

  <h2>Dragon Project Revision and Reflection</h2>
  <p>The person that I collected feedback from for my Dragon project was my sister. Some issues or problems that she noticed were that the color of the table didn't really match the rest of the website, that the font not fit the futuristic theme the website was supposed to be, and that the contact form would look better at the bottom of the FAQ page.</p>

  <p>My learning experience during this semester was good. I think I learned a lot. Some things that I did well was organizing my information on my website, though I don't think I am very adept at making stylesheets yet. I have decided to follow my sister's recommended changes. They are reasonable and I agree with them.</p>
